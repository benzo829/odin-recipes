    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>I grew up eating Stagg's Chili from cans, so eating homemade chili for the first time was a revelation. I don't remember
        when that was, but I've been on the search for a solid chili recipe since then. During the Obama presidency some online
        blog published what was claimed to be Michelle Obama's recipe for chili. It's pretty healthy and easy to make, but the 
        flavor profile could be better. I made it a lot for family dinner, but it got to a point where the kids started groaning
        when I mentioned the recipe, so atm this recipe is on the shelf. I may dust it off for myself in the near future.
