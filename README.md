The point of this project is to try to create a webpage that presents a recipe in a format that is easily readable. It should have clear cooking instructions, a few pictures to illustrate the preparation steps and finished food product, and some basic nutrition information. I will demonstrate how to format text, show pictures, and link to related web pages both externally and within the site itself.
